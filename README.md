# AutoDocs
Allows to automate the updating of documents related to job application.

When I am done modifying one resume in Overleaf, the script should:
- download the updated resume
- upload it to the appropriate resume in Linkedin
- upload it to the appropriate resume in Google Drive

Others:
- translate the updated resume in German and upload the corresponding resume in Overleaf
- do the same as before
